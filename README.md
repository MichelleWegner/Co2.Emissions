# Project Summary and Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature changes, and to investigate various hypotheses related to these variables, particularly in the context of development status (developed vs. developing countries).

## Data Collection and Preparation

### We utilized two datasets:
   1. CO2 Emissions and Population Data (df1): This dataset contains information about CO2 emissions and population for various countries over several years.
   2. Temperature Data (df2): This dataset includes temperature changes for various countries over several years.
#### To prepare the data for analysis, we:
   1. Removed non-country entries and standardized country names.
   2. Merged the datasets on country and year.
   3. Ensured the correct data types for all relevant columns.
   4. Removed rows with missing values and duplicates.
## Hypotheses and Analyses
   1. Hypothesis 1: Countries in the Global North produce more CO2 emissions.
      - Analysis: We compared the average CO2 emissions between countries classified as "Global North" and "Global South".
      - Result: The t-test showed a statistically significant difference in CO2 emissions, with Global North countries producing more CO2 emissions.
   2. Hypothesis 2: Countries that produce the most CO2 emissions are the least impacted by temperature rise.
      - Analysis: We identified the top CO2 emitting countries and compared their temperature changes to other countries.
      - Result: The t-test did not support the hypothesis, showing no significant difference in temperature changes between top CO2 emitters and other countries.
   3. Hypothesis 3: Global temperature rise is strongly correlated with the increase in CO2 emissions.
      - Analysis: We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between CO2 emissions and temperature changes.
      - Result: There was a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient > 0.8), supporting the hypothesis that increased CO2 emissions are associated with rising temperatures.
   4. Hypothesis 4: Developing countries are more vulnerable to temperature change impacts despite contributing less to global CO2 emissions.
      - Analysis: We compared CO2 emissions and temperature changes between developed and developing countries.
      - Result: The t-test showed a significant difference in CO2 emissions (higher in developed countries) and temperature changes (higher in developing countries), supporting the hypothesis.
## Additional Analysis: Trends Over Time
   We analyzed the trends of CO2 emissions and temperature changes over time for both developed and developing countries.
   - CO2 Emissions Over Time: Developed countries showed higher CO2 emissions historically, but trends indicated a possible reduction in recent years. Developing countries, although lower in absolute emissions, showed an increasing trend.
   - Temperature Changes Over Time: Temperature changes have been rising for both groups, with developing countries experiencing more pronounced increases.
## Prediction for the Next Decade
Using the trends observed in the data, we can make the following predictions:

   1. CO2 Emissions:
      - Developed Countries: Efforts to reduce emissions (e.g., policies, technology) may continue to decrease CO2 emissions. However, the reduction rate might slow down unless more aggressive measures are implemented.
      - Developing Countries: Emissions are likely to increase due to industrialization and economic growth. However, the adoption of greener technologies could mitigate the growth rate.

   2. Temperature Rise:
      - Based on the strong correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature changes, we can predict that if CO2 emissions continue to rise, global temperatures will also continue to increase.
      - Developed countries, despite reducing emissions, will still experience temperature rises due to historical emissions and global interconnectedness.
      - Developing countries, with increasing emissions, will face even more significant temperature increases, exacerbating vulnerability to climate impacts.

## Conclusion
The project provided a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature changes. Our findings support the hypotheses that Global North countries emit more CO2 and that there is a strong correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature rise. Furthermore, developing countries are more vulnerable to the impacts of temperature changes despite contributing less to global emissions. These insights highlight the need for global cooperation in reducing emissions and mitigating climate change, with particular attention to the challenges faced by developing countries.
Visualization Summary
   1. Boxplots and Bar Plots: Compared CO2 emissions and temperature changes between different groups (Global North vs. Global South, developed vs. developing countries).
   2. Line Plots: Showed trends of CO2 emissions and temperature changes over time.
   3. Scatter Plot with Regression Line: Illustrated the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature changes.
   4. Heatmap: Displayed the correlation matrix of key variables, highlighting the strong relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature changes.
## Future Work
For future analyses, it would be beneficial to:
   1. Include more granular data (e.g., sector-specific emissions) to better understand the sources of CO2 emissions.
   2. Analyze the impact of specific policies on emission trends.
   3. Use advanced predictive models (e.g., machine learning) to forecast future emissions and temperature changes with higher accuracy.
These steps will provide deeper insights and support more effective strategies to combat climate change globally.
