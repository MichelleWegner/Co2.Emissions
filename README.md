This data analysis project tackles a crucial issue: understanding the relationship between CO2 emissions, global temperature rise, and population. By meticulously cleaning and merging three separate datasets – CO2 emissions, Earth's temperature, and population data – we aim to create a comprehensive picture that allows us to test essential hypotheses. These hypotheses delve into the critical questions surrounding climate change:

Do wealthier nations contribute more to CO2 emissions?
Are countries with the highest emissions least affected by rising temperatures?
Is there a strong link between rising CO2 emissions and global temperature increase over the past century?
Are developing nations, despite emitting less CO2, more susceptible to the consequences of climate change?
By analyzing this merged data, we hope to shed light on these critical questions and contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discussion around climate change and global sustainability.
